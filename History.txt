* No Map::default_center, because of auto centering through google when markers.count > 1
* If no option[:markers] are given, they will be set to []. Otherwise the constant markers array will grow to unlimited.
* Setting constants like geokit do it.
  In initializers you can overwrite it like
  StaticGmaps::default_size = [ 170, 200 ]
* Now on http://github.com/dmattes/static-gmaps/
